This web site is dedicated to help you use and develop for ejabberd
XMPP messaging server.

ejabberd has been in development since 2002 and is used all over the
world to power the largest XMPP deployments. This project is so
versatile that you can deploy it and customize it for very large
scale, no matter what your use case is.

This incredible power comes with a price. You need to learn how to
leverage it. Fortunately, the goal of this website is to get you
started on your path to mastery. Whether you are a sysadmin, an
architect, a developer planning to extend it, or even a simple XMPP
user, we have something for you here.

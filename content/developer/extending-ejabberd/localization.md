# Internationalization and Localization

The source code of ejabberd supports localization:
all built-in modules support the `xml:lang` attribute inside IQ queries, and the Web Admin supports the `Accept-Language` HTTP header.

There are two ways to improve the translation of a language:

- Edit the corresponding .po file in [ejabberd-po git repository](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd-po) with a gettext-compatible program (Poedit, KBabel, Lokalize, ...). Then submit a Pull Request.

- Using the [ejabberd-po Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/ejabberd/ejabberd-po/) online service.

Once the translators have improved the `po` files, you can run `make translations`.
With that command, the translatable strings are extracted from source code to generate the file `ejabberd.pot`.
This file is merged with each .po file to produce updated .po files. Finally those .po files are exported to .msg files, that have a format easily readable by ejabberd.

This page explains ejabberd SQL database schema.  We present the tables that might be in use, depending on your server configuration, together with a short explanation of the fields involved and their intended use. Tables are presented roughly grouped by related functionality.

Consider this document a work in progress, not all tables are documented yet.

Latest version of database schema are available in [ejabberd Github repository](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd):

* [MS SQL Server schema](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/blob/master/sql/mssql.sql)
* [MySQL schema](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/blob/master/sql/mysql.sql)
* [Postgres schema](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/blob/master/sql/pg.sql)
* [SQLite schema](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/blob/master/sql/lite.sql). This
  schema need testing / feedback and possibly improvement from SQL
  Server users.

# Authentication

## Table `users`

Contains the information required to authenticate users.

| Field                | Type             | Usage                                                                                   |

| username             | string           | User                                                                                    |
| password             | string           | User password, can be hashed                                                            |

The password are hashed if you use SCRAM authentication. In that case the next fields are also defined

| Field                | Type             | Usage                                                                                   |

# Rosters

## Table `rosterusers`

This is a quite complex table, used as a store for a quite complex protocol that is the one defined to manage
rosters and subscriptions on [rfc6121](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6121).  

In the common case of two users adding each other as contacts, entries in the roster table follows a series of steps
 as they moves from a subscription request to the final approval and bi-directional subscription being established. 
This process can be initiated either by the user, or by the (possible remote) peer. Also need to account for the case
where the user, or the contact, might not be online at the moment of the subscription request is made.

Steps are further complicated by the fact that entries in the roster aren't required to have corresponding subscriptions. 
For details of the meaning of the different fields, refer to [the protocol itself](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6121#section-2), as these are mostly a direct mapping of it. 
 
Note:
If you manage users contacts from outside the roster workflow of XMPP (for example your site backends perform the linking between
users),  it is likely that you only need to care about the  username, jid and nick fields,  and set the subscription field to be always
'B' for a mutual link between users.


| Field                | Type             | Usage                                                                                   |

## Table `rostergroups`

## Table `sr_group`

## Table `sr_user`



# Messages

## Table `spool`
Messages sent to users that are offline are stored in this table. 
Do not confuse this with general message archiving: messages are only temporarily stored in this table, removed as soon as the target user 
is back online and the pending messages delivered to it.

| Field                | Type             | Usage                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| username             | string           | User                                                                                    |
| xml                  | blob             | Raw packet                                                                              |
| seq                  | integer          | Unique, autoincrement sequence number.                                                  |
| created_at           | timestamp        | When the message was stored                                                             |

The seq field is used for sorting, and to easily identify a particular user message.


## Table `privacy_list_data`

The table is used to store privacy rules.

The table is a direct translation of the XMPP packet used to set
privacy lists. For more details, please read
[XEP-0016: Privacy Lists, Syntax and Semantics](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0016.html#protocol-syntax). Here
is an example packet coming from privacy list specification:

    
    <item
         type='[jid|group|subscription]'
         value='bar'
         action='[allow|deny]'
         order='unsignedInt'>
        [<message/>]
        [<presence-in/>]
        [<presence-out/>]
        [<iq/>]
     </item>

The table fields are defined as follow:

| Field                | Type             | Usage                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id                   | int              | Privacy list rule id.                                                                   |
| t                    | char             | Privacy rule type: 'j' for jid, 'g' for group and 's' for subscription.                 |
| value                | string           | Privacy list value for match, whose content depends on privacy list rule type.          |
| action               | char             | Privacy list action: 'd' for deny and 'a' for allow.                                    |
| ord                  | int              | Order for applying the privacy list rule.                                               |
| match\_all           | boolean (0 or 1) | If true (1), means any packet types will be matched. Other matches should be false (0). |
| match\_iq            | boolean (0 or 1) | If true (1), means iq packets will be matched by rule.                                  |
| match\_message       | boolean (0 or 1) | If true (1), means message packets type will be matched by rule.                        |
| match\_presence\_in  | boolean (0 or 1) | If true (1), means inbound presence packets type will be matched by rule.               |
| match\_presence\_out | boolean (0 or 1) | If true (1), means outbound packets type will be matched by rule.                       |



# Multiuser Chat Rooms

## Table `muc_room`
It is used to store *persistent* rooms, that is, rooms that must be automatically started with the server.

| Field                | Type             | Usage                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name                 | string           | Room name                                                                               |
| host                 | string           | Hostname of the conference component                                                    |
| opts                 | string           | Room options, encoded as erlang terms                                                   |
| created_at           | timestamp        | Creation date                                                                           |

The opts field is legible, but not mean to be modified directly. It contents depends on the implementation of mod_muc. 
It contains the room configuration and affiliations.


## Table `muc_registered`
Contains a map of user to nicknames.  When a user register a nickname with the conference module, that nick is reserved and can't be used by 
anyone else, in any room from that conference host.

| Field                | Type             | Usage                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| jid                  | string           | User jid                                                                                |
| host                 | string           | Hostname of the conference component                                                    |
| nick                 | string           | Room options, encoded as erlang terms                                                   |
| created_at           | timestamp        | Creation date                                                                           |


## Table `room_history`
In ejabberd Business Edition,
this table is used if persistent room history is enabled. If so, recent room history is saved to the DB before ejabberd is stopped,
allowing the recent history to survive server restarts.

| Field                | Type             | Usage                                                                                   |

| nick                 | string           | Nickname that sent the message                                                          |
| packet               | string           | XML stanza with the message                                                             |
| have_subject         | boolean          | True if the message stanza had subject                                                  |
| created_at           | timestamp        | Creation date                                                                           |
| size                 | integer          | Size in bytes of the xml packet                                                         |

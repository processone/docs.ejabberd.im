# Using ejabberd with MySQL

ejabberd is bundled with a native Erlang driver to use MySQL as a
backend for persistent storage.
Using MySQL as backend is thus extremely straightforward.

## ejabberd installation

ejabberd packages and binary installers contain all the modules needed
to connect to your MySQL server. You have no extra module to install
anymore.

If you are building ejabberd from source, make sure that
you configure ejabberd to include MySQL module. It can be done by
passing option `--enable-mysql` to `configure` script. For example:

``` sh
cd ejabberd-source
./configure --enable-mysql
```

## MySQL installation

You need a MySQL server that you can point your ejabberd configuration
to. The database does not have to be on the same server than ejabberd.

### Requirements

ejabberd uses FULLTEXT indexes with InnoDB. Thus, you need
MySQL 5.6 or greater to use with ejabberd.

**Note:** If you do not store message archive in database however, you
can try using older 5.5 version. You may need to adapt MySQL database
schema to cope with those older MySQL versions.

### MySQL on Linux

This documentation will not get into the details of making MySQL
running on Linux for production. It is dependent on Linux distribution
and system administrators preferences and habits.

It is also well documented, so it should not be an issue.

### Amazon RDS compliance

ejabberd is fully compliant with
[MySQL on Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html).

You just need to make sure to use MySQL version 5.6 or greater when you
create your database.

### MySQL on OSX with Homebrew

For testing / development, it is common to start experimenting with
MySQL with [Homebrew installation](https://brew.sh/).

Here is how to get started to help with setup up environment.

With Homebrew properly installed, you can use the following command to install MySQL:

``` sh
brew install mysql
```

You can then follow instruction to finish the installation, for
example by running `mysql_secure_installation`.

You can manually start server with:

``` sh
mysql.server start
```

To connect to your local MySQL server using `mysql` command-line,
assuming you kept the default set up, use:

``` sh
mysql -uroot
```

To stop it, use:

``` sh
mysql.server stop
```

<!--
Should we also show how to restart from scratch by removing old Homebrew versions ?
Here is how to do it:
  brew remove mysql
  brew uninstall --force mysql
  sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql
-->

### MySQL on Windows with Bash

On Windows you can install MySQL easily like on Linux using Ubuntu Bash:

``` sh
sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6
```

After configuration, you can start MySQL with:

``` sh
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
```

You can connect on the database with your created admin password:

``` sh
mysql -uroot -ppassword
```


## MySQL database creation

### Create ejabberd user and database

MySQL admins should use this procedure and grant rights to a dedicated
`ejabberd` user (replace password with your desired password):

``` sh
echo "GRANT ALL ON ejabberd.* TO 'ejabberd'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';" | mysql -h localhost -u root
```

You can then create a dedicated ejabberd database (use password
created earlier):

``` sh
echo "CREATE DATABASE ejabberd;" | mysql -h localhost -u ejabberd -p
```

You should now be able to connect to ejabberd database with user
`ejabberd` (use password defined on GRANT command):

``` sh
mysql -h localhost -u ejabberd -p -D ejabberd

```

### Decide which SQL schema to use

Read carefully the
[Default and New Schemas](../admin/configuration/database.md/#default-and-new-schemas)
section and decide which schema is preferable in your case: the default or the new schema.

Then modify the `ejabberd.yml` configuration file to setup your desired option value:

``` yaml
new_sql_schema: true
```

### Use automatic schema update

Since ejabberd [23.10](../archive/23.10/index.md),
ejabberd can take care to create the tables automatically
the first time it starts with an empty database,
and also takes care to update the database schema when you upgrade ejabberd to a newer version.

That feature works both for default and new SQL schema, for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

To enable automatic database schema creation and update, simply add in your `ejabberd.yml` configuration file:

``` yaml
update_sql_schema: true
```

In that case, you don't need to load the database schema manually:
no need to read the next section.


### Load database schema manually

MySQL default schema is defined in a file called `mysql.sql`,
and the new schema is `mysql.new.sql`.
Some tables of the schema are described in:
[ejabberd SQL database schema documentation](../developer/sql-schema.md/).

Those schema files can be found:

* Git repository and source code package: [`/sql/` directory](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/tree/master/sql)

* When installed from source code or binary installer, the SQL schemas are copied to
  `PREFIX/lib/ejabberd-VERSION/priv/sql`

Load the schema in your ejabberd database with the command:

``` sh
mysql -h localhost -D ejabberd -u ejabberd -p < mysql.sql
```

To make sure all looks fine, you can show the list of SQL tables:

``` sh
echo "SHOW TABLES;" | mysql -h localhost -D ejabberd -u ejabberd -p --table

```

Your database is now ready to connect with ejabberd.

## ejabberd configuration

### Setup MySQL connection

In `ejabberd.yml`, define your database parameters:

``` yaml
sql_type: mysql
sql_server: "localhost"
sql_database: "ejabberd"
sql_username: "ejabberd"
sql_password: "password"
## If you want to specify the port:
sql_port: 3306
```

Those parameters are mandatory if you want to use MySQL with ejabberd.

### Authentication use MySQL

If you decide to store user password in ejabberd, you need to tell
ejabberd to use MySQL instead of internal database for authentication.

You thus need to change ejabberd configuration `auth_method` to
replace `internal` authentication with `sql`:

``` yaml
auth_method: sql
```

If you restart ejabberd, it should connect to your database for
authentication. In case it does not work as expected, check your
config file syntax and log files (`ejabberd.log`, `error.log`,
`crash.log`)

For example, you can create a user in database with `ejabberdctl`:

``` sh
/sbin/ejabberdctl register "testuser" "localhost" "passw0rd"

User testuser@localhost successfully registered
```

You should now be able to connect XMPP users based on MySQL user base.

### Modules use MySQL

At this stage, only the authentication / user base has been moved to
MySQL. For data managed by modules, ejabberd still uses the Mnesia internal
database by default; you can decide to use MySQL on a module-by-module basis.

For each modules that support SQL backend, you can pass option
`db_type: sql` to use your configured MySQL database. Switch can be
done on a module by module basis. For example, if you want to store
contact list in MySQL, you can do:

``` yaml
modules:
  mod_roster:
    db_type: sql
```

However, if you want to use MySQL for all modules that support MySQL,
you can simply use global option `default_db: sql`:

``` yaml
default_db: sql
```

**Note:** even if you move all the persistent data you can to MySQL,
Mnesia will still be started and used to manage clustering.

## Migrating data from internal to MySQL

To migrate your data, once you have setup your sql service, you can
move most of the data to your database.

You need to take precautions before you launch the migration:

1. Before you launch migration from internal database, make sure you have
made a proper backup.

2. Always try the migration first on an instance created from your data
backup, to make sure the migration script will work fine on your
dataset.

3. Then, when doing final migration, make sure your instance is not
accepting connections by blocking incoming connections, for example
with firewall rules (block port 5222, 5269 and 5280 as default).

When you are ready, you can:

1. Connect to a running ejabberd:

    ``` sh
    ./ejabberdctl debug
    ```

2. Alternatively, use `ejabberdctl live` to launch ejabberd with an Erlang shell attached.

3. Launch the migration command `ejd2sql:export/2` from Erlang
shell. First parameter is the XMPP domain name you want to migrate
(i.e `localhost`). Second parameter `sql` tells ejabberd to export to
configured MySQL database. For example:

    ``` erlang
    ejd2sql:export(<<"localhost">>, sql).
    ```

You should be set now.

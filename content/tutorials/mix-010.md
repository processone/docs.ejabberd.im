MIX stands for Mediated Information eXchange and defined in
MIX-CORE ([XEP-0369](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0369.html)),
MIX-PRESENCE ([XEP-0403](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0403.html))
and MIX-PAM ([XEP-0405](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0405.html)).
More concretely, ejabberd supports [MIX 0.13.0](https://xmpp.org/extensions/attic/xep-0369-0.13.0.html).

It is a work in progress extension for the XMPP protocol to build a
group messaging protocol that does not rely on the presence
mechanism. It is designed to overcome the limitation of
Multi-User Chat
([XEP-0045](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html))
, in a context where most clients are mobile clients.

To do so, MIX is built on top of PubSub
([XEP-0060](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html)) and use
different nodes per channel to separate event types. There is five
nodes to support five different types of event for each MIX
channel:

* Messages
* Presence
* Participant list changes
* Subject update
* Conversion configuration changes

This is a work in progress, but this is a very important task and we
are happy to provide the very first server implementation of the Mix
protocol to get up to speed on that specification.

Here is a short walk through what can already be done.

Please, note that this is a work in progress and that the
specification can (and will) change significantly before it becomes
stable. This blog post is based on XEP-0369 v0.1.

# Configuration

Configuration is simple:

* Install a recent ejabberd version (19.02 or newer)

* You need to add
[mod_mix](/admin/configuration/modules/#mod-mix)
and [mod_mix_pam](/admin/configuration/modules/#mod-mix-pam)
in ejabberd configuration, modules section:

  ~~~ yaml
  modules:
  ...
    mod_mix: {}
    mod_mix_pam: {}
  ~~~

* Make sure you have PubSub enabled. Default configuration is fine:

  ~~~ yaml
  modules:
    ...
    mod_pubsub:
      access_createnode: pubsub_createnode
      plugins:
        - "flat"
        - "pep"
  ~~~

* The examples assume you have this virtual host:

  ~~~ yaml
  hosts:
    ...
    - shakespeare.example
  ~~~

# Usage

There is no client supporting MIX yet so here is how it works directly
at XMPP stream level.

Here are real-life examples from playing with our MIX implementation:

## Creating a MIX Channel


First of all, create a new MIX channel following
[7.3.2 Creating a Channel](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0369.html#usecase-admin-create):

~~~ xml
<iq id='lx09df27'
    to='mix.shakespeare.example'
    type='set'>
  <create channel='coven' xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:core:0'/>
</iq>
~~~

## Joining a MIX Channel

Now tell your server that you want your account to join that MIX channel, using
[MIX-PAM: 2.7 Joining a Channel](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0405.html#usecase-user-join):

~~~ xml
<iq type='set'
    to='hag66@shakespeare.example'
    id='E6E10350-76CF-40C6-B91B-1EA08C332FC7'>
  <client-join xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:pam:0'
               channel='coven@mix.shakespeare.example'>
    <join xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:core:0'>
      <nick>third witch</nick>
      <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages'></subscribe>
      <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence'></subscribe>
      <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants'></subscribe>
      <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:subject'></subscribe>
      <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:config'></subscribe>
    </join>
  </client-join>
</iq>
~~~

You receive IQ that confirms success:

~~~ xml
<iq type="result"
    from="hag66@shakespeare.example"
    to="hag66@shakespeare.example/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael"
    id="E6E10350-76CF-40C6-B91B-1EA08C332FC7">
  <client-join xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:pam:0'>
    <join xmlns="urn:xmpp:mix:core:0"
          jid='d79d011852b97adfaad6#coven@mix.shakespeare.example'>
      <nick>third witch</nick>
      <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages"></subscribe>
      <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence"></subscribe>
      <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants"></subscribe>
      <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:subject"></subscribe>
      <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:config"></subscribe>
   </join>
  </client-join>
</iq>
~~~

Subscribers on the participants node for that channel will also
receive the new list of participants (so, including ourselves in that
case):

~~~ xml
<message from="coven@mix.shakespeare.example"
         type="headline"
         to="hag66@shakespeare.example/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael">
 <event xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event">
  <items node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants">
   <item id="3d1766e2bd1b02167104f350f84b0668f850ef92">
    <participant xmlns="urn:xmpp:mix:core:0" jid="hag66@shakespeare.example"></participant>
   </item>
  </items>
 </event>
</message>
~~~

## Setting a nick

You may want to set a nick for this channel (see
[7.1.4 Setting a Nick](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0369.html#usecase-setting-nick)):

~~~ xml
<iq type='set'
    to='coven@mix.shakespeare.example'
    id='7nve413p'>
  <setnick xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:core:0'>
    <nick>thirdwitch</nick>
  </setnick>
</iq>
~~~

Note: Support for MIX nickname registration is not implemented in ejabberd.

## Sending and receiving messages

You can now start chatting with your peers, by publishing on the
message node
(see [7.1.6 Sending a Message](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0369.html#usecase-user-message)):

~~~ xml
<message to='coven@mix.shakespeare.example'
         id='92vax143g'
         type='groupchat'>
  <body>Harpier cries: 'tis time, 'tis time.</body>
</message>
~~~

The message is received by all subscribers on the message node on that MIX channel:

~~~ xml
<message
	to='hag77@shakespeare.example'
	from='coven@mix.shakespeare.example/19be8c262ed618e078b7'
	type='groupchat'
	id='1625493702877370'>
  <mix xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:core:0'>
    <nick>thirdwitch</nick>
    <jid>hag66@shakespeare.example</jid>
  </mix>
  <body>Harpier cries: &apos;tis time, &apos;tis time.</body>
</message>
~~~

## Querying participants list

A participant can always get list of participants with a PubSub query
on node items for the channel
(see [6.6 Determining the Participants in a Channel](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0369.html#find-channel-participants)):

~~~ xml
<iq type='get'
    to='coven@mix.shakespeare.example'
    id='mix4'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <items node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants'></items>
  </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

The channel will reply with list of participants:

~~~ xml
<iq to='hag66@shakespeare.example/tka1'
    from='coven@mix.shakespeare.example'
    type='result'
    id='kl2fax27'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <items node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants'>
      <item id='19be8c262ed618e078b7'>
        <participant nick='thirdwitch'
	jid='hag66@shakespeare.example'
	xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:core:0'/>
      </item>
      <item id='6be2b26cbf4d7108f1fb'>
        <participant jid='hag77@shakespeare.example'
	xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:core:0'/>
      </item>
    </items>
  </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

# Caveats

At the moment it is unclear from XEP-0369 example how you match a
message you receive to a participant. We are going to improve our
implementation in the following way:

1. Add a participant id on the item tag when broadcasting new participant.
2. Add the participant id on the published items.
3. Add the participant id in participants list on the publisher

Another issue is that the current specification and implementation
will have trouble scaling and offer plenty of opportunities for
"Denial of Service" attacks. This is something that will change in the
future as the specification matures. However, currently, do not deploy
or rely on this implementation for large-scale production
services. The work is still an experiment to progress on the
specifications by offering client developers to give real life
feedback on a reference implementation of the current specification.

# Conclusion

We are only at the beginning of MIX. However, we are excited to have
reached a point where it is already usable in some cases.

It is still missing on administrative tasks, right management, user
invitations, relationship with MAM archiving and probably a lot
more. And we need consolidations on participants message
attribution. However, we want to iterate fast with client developers
to prototype implementation changes and have meaningful and real life
feedback to improve XEP-0359.

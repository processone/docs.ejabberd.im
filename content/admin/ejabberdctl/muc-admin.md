# Prerequisite

Most of the command to manage MUC service depends on the activation of
`mod_muc_admin` module in ejabberd.

`mod_muc_admin` is included in ejabberd main code base since
[ejabberd 15.04][1].

To enable `mod_muc_admin`-dependant `ejabberdctl` commands, you just
need to add `mod_muc_admin` in `modules` section of ejabberd config
file.

For example, in `ejabberd.yml` format: 

~~~ yaml
modules:
  mod_muc_admin: {}
~~~

# File format

## Yaml File Format

ejabberd loads its configuration file during startup.
This configuration file is written in
[`YAML`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format,
and its file name MUST have “.yml” or “.yaml” extension.
This helps ejabberd to differentiate between this new format
and the [legacy configuration file](#legacy-configuration-file) format.

Please, consult `ejabberd.log` for configuration errors. ejabberd will
report syntax related errors, as well as complains about unknown options
and invalid values. Make sure you respect indentation (YAML is
sensitive to this) or you will get pretty cryptic errors.

Note that ejabberd never edits the configuration file. If you are
changing parameters at runtime from web admin interface, you will need to apply
them to configuration file manually. This is to prevent messing up
with your config file comments, syntax, etc.

## Reload at Runtime

You can modify the ejabberd configuration file
and reload it at runtime:
the changes you made are applied immediately,
no need to restart ejabberd.
This applies to adding, changing or removing
vhosts, listened ports, modules, ACLs or any other options.

How to do this?

1. Let's assume your ejabberd server is already running
2. Modify the configuration file
3. Run the [reload_config](../../developer/ejabberd-api/admin-api.md#reload_config) command
4. ejabberd will read that file, check its YAML syntax is valid,
   check the options are valid and known...
5. If there's any problem in the configuration file,
   the reload is aborted and an error message is logged with details,
   so you can fix the problem.
6. If the file is right, it detects the changed options,
   and applies them immediately (add/remove hosts, add/remove modules, ...)

## Legacy Configuration File

In previous ejabberd version the configuration file should be
written in Erlang terms. The format is still supported, but it is
highly recommended to convert it to the new YAML format with the
[convert_to_yaml](../../developer/ejabberd-api/admin-api.md#convert_to_yaml)
API command using [ejabberdctl](../guide/managing.md#ejabberdctl).

If you want to specify some options using the old Erlang format, you
can set them in an additional cfg file, and include it using the
`include_config_file` option, see
[Include Additional Files](#include-additional-files).

## Include Additional Files

The option [include_config_file](toplevel.md#include_config_file)
 in a configuration file instructs
ejabberd to include other configuration files immediately.

This is a basic example:

``` yaml
include_config_file: /etc/ejabberd/additional.yml
```

In this example, the included file is not allowed to contain a `listen`
option. If such an option is present, the option will not be accepted.
The file is in a subdirectory from where the main configuration file is.

``` yaml
include_config_file:
  ./example.org/additional_not_listen.yml:
    disallow: [listen]
```

Please notice that options already defined in the main configuration file
cannot be redefined in the included configuration files.
But you can use [host_config](toplevel.md#host_config)
and [append_host_config](toplevel.md#append_host_config)
as usual (see [Virtual Hosting](basic.md#virtual-hosting)).

In this example, `ejabberd.yml` defines some ACL for the whole ejabberd server, and later includes another file:

``` yaml
acl:
  admin:
    user:
      - admin@localhost
include_config_file:
  /etc/ejabberd/acl.yml
```

The file `acl.yml` can add additional administrators to one of the virtual hosts:

``` yaml
append_host_config:
  localhost:
    acl:
      admin:
        user:
          - bob@localhost
          - jan@localhost
```

## Macros in Configuration File

In the ejabberd configuration file, it is possible to define a macro
for a value and later use this macro when defining an option.

A macro is defined using the [define_macro](toplevel.md#define_macro) option.

This example shows the basic usage of a macro:

``` yaml
define_macro:
  LOG_LEVEL_NUMBER: 5
loglevel: LOG_LEVEL_NUMBER
```

The resulting option interpreted by ejabberd is: `loglevel: 5`.

This example shows that values can be any arbitrary YAML value:

``` yaml
define_macro:
  USERBOB:
    user:
      - bob@localhost
acl:
  admin: USERBOB
```

The resulting option interpreted by ejabberd is:

``` yaml
acl:
  admin:
    user:
      - bob@localhost
```

This complex example:

``` yaml
define_macro:
  NUMBER_PORT_C2S: 5222
  NUMBER_PORT_HTTP: 5280
listen:
  -
    port: NUMBER_PORT_C2S
    module: ejabberd_c2s
  -
    port: NUMBER_PORT_HTTP
    module: ejabberd_http
```

produces this result after being interpreted:

``` yaml
listen:
  -
    port: 5222
    module: ejabberd_c2s
  -
    port: 5280
    module: ejabberd_http
```
